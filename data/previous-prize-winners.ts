			"WALKR combines GPS coordinates with advanced geospatial mapping to instantly pinpoint the user’s location and provide guidance based on nearby landmarks. Our approach integrates real-time positioning with the angle and orientation of the user’s phone to project an accurate walking route displayed in a mixed-reality headset. Users can simply say their destination aloud, and WALKR’s hands-free voice recognition sets up a precise route without needing a glance at the screen. Notably, WALKR also offers a fully integrated wheelchair-accessible route option, ensuring that users with mobility challenges receive optimal path guidance.",

			'"Green" is an app built to reduce traffic emissions by helping drivers find routes with minimal stops as possible. It analyzes current traffic for a route and dynamically recommends routes that avoid traffic hotspots, ensuring drivers spend less time in traffic even though, now the travel time has increased. Every time a user completes a route with fewer emissions, they earn points. These points can then be redeemed for discounts or rewards offered by environmentally conscious companies, such as WWF, National Geographic, and others dedicated to environmental causes.',
